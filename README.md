# Image-based-Age-and-Gender-Predictor-Deep-Learning-Project

Utilized deep learning techniques like CNN with transfer learning to build an image classifier and regressor model that predicts the age and gender of individuals based on given images. 

Achieved an accuracy of 85% for the gender classification and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 7 for age prediction, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in predicting age and gender.
